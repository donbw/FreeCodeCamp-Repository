          Joe Rogan started the 'The Joe Rogan Experience' podcast (JRE podcast) back in December 24, 2009 with Brian Redban. A friend and fellow comedian: a self-taught videographer who helped produce, film, and edit the show.
          </br>
          As popularity grew, in January 2015, the podcast was listened to by over 11 million people, and by October 2015 it had grown to acquire 16 million downloads per month.
          <br>
          The JRE podcast ranked the highest in the unaided awareness category, doubling that of any other podcast out there.
          His podcasts have been so influential that guests like Elon Musk, seen smoking cannibis on the show, caused Tesla's stock price to fall 9%, days later.

          Guests, coming on the show, are often experts in their respective fields. Each episode usually has one guest per podcast, typically lasting 2 to 3 hours.
          </br>
          This 'long form' style of conversation, allows the listener to gain a greater understanding for the ideas, opinions, and expertise of the guests. Also Joe's, thoughtful and mindful way of conversing with his guests, have resulted in catapulting his show to #1.
